    "summary": "<p><b>Queer Eye</b> is an American reality television series that premiered on the cable television network Bravo during July 2003. The program's original name <i>Queer Eye for the Straight Guy</i> was changed after the third season to generalize the scope of its content. The series was created by executive producers David Collins and Michael Williams along with their producing partner David Metzler. The series is premised on and uses the stereotypes that homosexual (\"queer\") men are superior in matters of fashion, style, personal grooming, interior design and culture. In each episode, the team of five homosexual men known collectively as the \"Fab Five\" perform a \"makeover\" (in the parlance of the show, a \"make-better\") on a person, usually a heterosexual (\"straight\") man, revamping his wardrobe, redecorating his home and offering advice on grooming, lifestyle and food. <i>Queer Eye for the Straight Guy</i> debuted during 2003, and quickly became a surprise success. The success of the series resulted in merchandising, franchising of the concept internationally, and a woman-oriented spin-off, <i>Queer Eye for the Straight Girl</i>. <i>Queer Eye</i> won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Reality Program during 2004. The series' name was abbreviated to <i>Queer Eye</i> at the beginning of its third season to represent the show's change from making over only heterosexual men to including women and homosexual men. <i>Queer Eye</i> ended production during 2006 June and the final ten episodes were broadcast during October 2007. The series ended October 30.</p>",

The film is set in post-WWII Moscow. Lieutenant Vladimir Sharapov (Vladimir Konkin) is a young reconnaissance officer and a decorated war hero who has just returned from the war and is assigned to peacetime service with the famous MUR (Moscow Department of Criminal Investigations). There he becomes part of an elite detective team led by the brilliant, tough, no-nonsense Captain Gleb Zheglov (Vysotsky). The duo becomes embroiled in two seemingly separate investigations: that of the murder of young aspiring actress Larisa Gruzdeva, and the hunt for a vicious gang of armed robbers that calls itself \"Black Cat\" and constantly manages to evade capture.</p>",

It also introduces Susan Sto Helit, daughter of Mort and Ysabell and granddaughter of Death. The series takes the association of the \"Band with Rocks In\" with the Beatles even further than the book does, evolving their style from 1950s rock and early 1960s beat music (and mixing-bowl haircuts) in Ankh-Morpork, to acid rock in Scrote, to spiritual hippie rock in Quirm. In Sto Lat, they sound like the Jimi Hendrix Experience or Bad Company, but are dressed in clothes similar to the Beatles on the cover of the Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album.</p>",

    "summary": "<p>Some academic geniuses suffer from burnout. Others simply lose all interest in their studies and want to focus on other things. Junichirou Kagami falls into the latter category. He was once a teenage physics genius whose papers were published in Nature, Science, and other prestigious research journals. Unfortunately, upon graduating from college, he left the science field and became a shut-in whose life motto is \"I can only do things I want to do.\"<br /><br />These days, Kagami spends all of his time watching anime, reading manga, collecting figures, and updating his blog. He seems satisfied with not having a job, but his younger sister, Suzune, cannot stand the thought of her brother being an unemployed loser for the rest of his life. She goes behind his back and gets him a job as a substitute teacher at his old high school. What lucky timing that the regular physics teacher had to go on maternity leave! And good thing his alma mater remembers him as that teenage genius! But can a hardcore otaku actually teach a bunch of high school students anything important and useful?</p>",

The Duke hates Lancre and the actual kingdom of Lancre is pressing the witches to find a king that would take better care of it. The second and bigger problem is that Verence's baby son has escaped and has fallen into the hands of the witches prompting the Duke's fury towards the witches.

Because of these giant bugs, humans do not live on the earth anymore, but in floating cities instead. However, this does not mean that everything is lost, because the wizards from prestigious floating wizard academies are fighting these monsters.<br><br>Kanata Age is a young man now labelled as a traitor even though he was once praised as the \"Black Master Swordsman.\" He gets a chance to repair his reputation by instructing the team E601, which seems to be facing some difficulties. It consists of three girls, Misora Whitale, Lecty Eisenach, and Rico Flamel, each with problems of their own. It appears that Kanata will get in deep waters more than once because of them...</p><p>(Source: MyAnimeList)</p>",

The results of each online episode directly impacts the Masters, awarding them advantages, such as immunity (the winner of each battle earns the Top Chef Master immunity), and sometimes, disadvantages, depending on their sous chef's performance (the chefs who perform the worst always earn obstacles for their Top Chef Master). Every episode of \"Battle of the Sous Chefs\" leads up to the next episode of Top Chef Masters, and explores the uniquely interdependent relationship between a Master chef and his or her sous chef.</p>",

Consequently, due to some slippery tile and some extra-prominent female appendages, Rito's suddenly on his way to being a member of the royal family. Unfortunately, as hot as Lala is, this is one royal family no one wants to become a part of given that her father, King Develuke, bears a suspicious resemblance to the devil! And then there's the little issue of the very nice human girl that Rito's already interested in, who's probably not going to be too understanding of his sudden involvement in intergalactic affairs. Will Rito become the next king of the galaxy? Will he learn the secret of the Big Bang? Find out in To Love Ru.</p>",

Amongst the youngsters, there is always one nerdy over-achiever, who often gets into a conflict with the other students, or with Jef, the lazy husband of Jeanne. Jef works for the public greens department, although he constantly invents excuses to skip a working day. Family friend Odilon, with whom Jef shares a passion for billiards and fishing, proves to be rather dumb and extremely naive, leading everyone who asks for his help to eventually end up regretting it.</p>",
